# About Me

I'm a machine learning researcher and data scientist based in Paris, working at the intersection of causal inference, representation learning, and applied statistics.

I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Paris-Saclay University, where my research focused on estimating treatment effects in longitudinal data. My dissertation, *Learning Causality for Longitudinal Data*, developed methods for counterfactual regression, identifiability in latent-variable models, and sequential decision optimization.

Before the PhD, I studied applied mathematics at CentraleSupélec and Centrale Casablanca, with a focus on data science and research.

## Research Interests

- **Causal inference**: treatment-effect estimation, uplift modeling, dynamic treatment regimes
- **Representation learning**: latent-variable models, identifiability, time-varying embeddings
- **Probabilistic modeling**: Bayesian methods, variational inference, uncertainty quantification
- **Applied ML**: predictive maintenance, forecasting, document understanding

## Work

I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at Saint-Gobain, where I lead projects on LLM-based document analysis and Bayesian predictive maintenance. Previously, I conducted my industrial PhD at the same company, building causal ML systems for commercial targeting across longitudinal customer data.

Before that, I interned at EDF Lab (time-series representation learning) and L'Oréal Paris (forecasting and clustering).

## Teaching

I taught machine learning courses at CentraleSupélec from 2022 to 2024, covering supervised learning, ensemble methods, and semi-supervised techniques for master's students in the Data Science & Business Analytics program (joint with ESSEC).
