# About

I’m **Mouad El Bouchattaoui (Mouad EB)**, a **researcher / data scientist** based in **Paris, France**.  
My work focuses on **causal inference**, **representation learning**, and **machine learning for sequential / time-series data**, with an emphasis on **identifiability**, **uncertainty**, and **real-world deployment**.

## Now
- Finishing / recently finished a PhD on: *“Learning causality with machine learning for the analysis and prediction of customer behavior.”*
- Building research + engineering projects around causal ML for complex industrial and sequential data.
- Open to: Research Scientist / Applied Scientist / Senior DS roles (Paris / EU; adjust as needed).

## Research interests
- Treatment effects & causal inference (especially longitudinal / sequential settings)
- Causal representation learning, identifiability, latent structure
- Probabilistic modeling, uncertainty estimation, distribution shift
- Time-series + event-driven modeling (industry / healthcare / finance)

## Education
- **PhD, Applied Mathematics / Causal Machine Learning** — (Your university), (Year)
  - Thesis: *Learning causality with machine learning for the analysis and prediction of customer behavior*
- **MSc, (Your program)** — (Your university), (Year)

## Experience
**Industrial Researcher / Data Scientist** — Saint-Gobain (Year–Present)  
- Built and deployed causal/statistical models for decision support on complex operational data.
- Designed robust evaluation protocols (uncertainty, sensitivity to seeds/bootstrapping, shift awareness).
- Delivered end-to-end pipelines (data → modeling → stakeholder-facing outputs).

**Data Science Research Project** — L’Oréal Paris (Year)  
- Time-series feature engineering + clustering; augmentation via DTW; forecasting with ARIMA/SARIMA/LSTM/DeepAR.
- (Add 1 bullet with a measurable outcome if you can.)
