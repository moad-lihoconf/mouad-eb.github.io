# Mouad El Bouchattaoui

I'm a researcher and data scientist working at the intersection of **Causal Inference**, **Representation Learning**, and **Applied Statistics**. I specialize in developing methods to make reliable decisions from high-dimensional, longitudinal data—whether in academic research or industrial production systems.

I hold a **Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics** from Paris-Saclay University. My dissertation, *Learning Causality for Longitudinal Data*, focused on counterfactual regression, identifiability in latent-variable models, and sequential decision optimization. My research has been published at premier venues like **NeurIPS**, **TMLR**, and **UAI**.

Currently, I am a **Senior Data Scientist at Saint-Gobain**, where I lead applied-ML projects with an emphasis on evaluation rigor and decision stability. My work ranges from building Bayesian predictive maintenance pipelines to developing retrieval-grounded LLM systems for contract compliance.

## Technical Focus

- **Causal Inference**: Counterfactual estimation, uplift modeling, and offline policy learning.
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Latent-variable models (VAEs/GANs), Bayesian inference, and event-time hazard modeling.
- **Representation Learning**: Self-supervised sequence modeling and identifiable representation learning for time-series.
- **ML Engineering**: Building scalable, production-grade pipelines with focus on robustness and reproducibility.

## Background

Before my PhD, I studied applied mathematics at **CentraleSupélec** and **Centrale Casablanca**, graduating in 2021. My journey has taken me from the theoretical foundations of stochastic processes to shipping production models that impact real-world business decisions.
