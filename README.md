## About
I work on **causal machine learning** with an emphasis on **identifiability**, **uncertainty**, and **real-world deployment** for complex data (events + text + hierarchies + time).  
PhD thesis: *“Learning causality with machine learning for the analysis and prediction of customer behavior.”*

---

## Research interests
- Causal inference & treatment effects (especially sequential / longitudinal settings)
- Causal representation learning and identifiability
- Probabilistic modeling, uncertainty estimation, distribution shift
- Time-series and event-driven modeling (industrial + healthcare + finance use-cases)

## Projects (featured)
A strong portfolio section usually reads like a mini case study: **Problem → Approach → Result → Artifacts**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 1) Causal Dynamic VAE (CDVAE) — Individual Treatment Effects with unobserved structure
- **Problem:** estimate ITEs under hidden/static confounding in sequential data
- **Approach:** probabilistic latent-variable modeling + identifiability-focused assumptions
- **Result:** (add 1–2 quantitative highlights)
- **Artifacts:** [[paper](LINK)] [[code](LINK)] [[slides](LINK)]

### 2) Transparent latent structure via Jacobian geometry (module discovery)
- **Problem:** recover interpretable latent modules driving groups of observed features
- **Approach:** Jacobian-based geometry + clustering stability analysis
- **Result:** (add key figure / metric)
- **Artifacts:** [[paper](LINK)] [[code](LINK)] [[demo](LINK)]

### 3) Industrial analytics: breakdown risk & root-cause reasoning (factory data)
- **Problem:** early risk prediction + top suspected causes at notification time
- **Approach:** event/time modeling + causal framing + robust evaluation
- **Result:** (latency / lift / accuracy / operational value)
- **Artifacts:** [[write-up](LINK)] [[code](LINK if public)]

---

## Experience (short)
- **Industrial Researcher / Data Scientist**, Saint-Gobain — causal/statistical modeling & decision support (YEAR–YEAR)
- **Data Science Research (MSc project)**, L’Oréal Paris — time-series clustering, DTW augmentation, forecasting (ARIMA/SARIMA/LSTM/DeepAR)

---

## Open-source & reproducibility
- Main repos: link your 3–6 best repositories.
- Each project repo should have a clean README + “How to run” + environment info (this signals seriousness). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
