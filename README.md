I'm a researcher and data scientist interested in how we can make reliable decisions from observational data. My work focuses on causal inference, representation learning, and probabilistic modeling—particularly for longitudinal and time-series data.

I completed my PhD at Paris-Saclay University, where I developed methods for counterfactual regression and treatment-effect estimation over time. My research has been published at NeurIPS, TMLR, and UAI.

Currently, I work as a Senior Data Scientist at Saint-Gobain, building production ML systems for document analysis and predictive maintenance.
